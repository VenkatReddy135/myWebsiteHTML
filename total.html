        <h3><i>THE LIFE OF A Sparrow</i></h3>
    
            <p class="text-muted"> In the Hindu tradition, as I had already said earlier, 
                water is one of the five elements of the nature, known as panchabhutas.
                 The ancient Hindu texts dealt extensively with the importance of water for 
                 the existence and survival of the human race.
                  Water played a defining role in creating and destroying the ancient
                  civilizations in the subcontinent and elsewhere.
